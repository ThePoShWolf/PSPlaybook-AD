# PSPlaybook-AD

Contained in this repo are all of the scripts I used for my Pluralsight course: [PowerShell Playbook: Automating Active Directory](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/powershell-playbook-automating-active-directory).

This code is free and available for public consumption! If you want more explanation of the code, check out the course itself. By doing so, you also support my work.

Thanks!
Anthony
